""What are Bitcoins?


Bitcoins are a new kind of money. They aren't created or controlled by a govemnment (like dollars or euros), they're
created and controlled by anybody who wants to be part of the Bitcoin payment network. Visit the Bitcoin.org website for all the geeky details.


How do I get a Bitcoin Receiving Address?


Download and install the Bitcoin program from www.biticoin.org. At the top of its main window it will show you Your Bitcoin Address.


I've got Bitcoins; how can I help?


Send them to the Bitcoin Faucet and they'll be given away. It may take up to 30 minutes for your donation to be added to the amount available


What's the catch?


No catch- want Bitcoin to be successful, so 1 created this Ittle service to give you a few coins to start with.

On Wednesday Night, Elon Musk tweeted:

Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin Mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.

Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment. 

Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. We are also looking at other Cryptocurrencies that use <1% of Bitcoin's energy/transaction",27292,6095,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nb0yz5/elon_musk_tesla_stops_accepting_bitcoin_as/,1620857699.0
44,1h2vzcp,I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin,"Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.",1172,558,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h2vzcp/i_hope_people_can_see_whats_happening_with_us/,1732914715.0

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

> In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. **As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets**, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. **We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them.**

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. 

I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  

""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.

""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. 

Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"". 

TL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.",11167,2404,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n57xbt/bitcoin_energy_usage_is_a_problem_and_the_crypto/,1620191218.0

Now I know that some names like Elon Musk can be pardoned for one reason or another but seeing Michael Saylor and Mark Cuban talk Bitcoin with the very embodiment of centralization - CZ Binance... I don't like where this is going.

Not to mention that we all expected BTC to become peer-to-peer cash, not a store of value for edgy hedge funds... It feels like we are going in the opposite direction when compared to the DeFi space and community-driven projects.


As far as I am concerned, the king is dead. The Billionaire Friends & Co are holding him hostage while telling us that everything is completely fine. This is not what I came here for and what I stand for.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.

So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!

This got me to thinking about the first time I heard of Bitcoin. I was a freshman in college and a computer science major. It was Fall of 2010. I was in the lab when a Sophomore csci major asked me if I wanted to help him set up the \~35 computers in the lab for mining Bitcoin.  His plan was to mine every night after classes ended until 8am when classes began again and 24 hours over the weekend.

Me, thinking it was a waste of time with Bitcoin being like $.06, said no. The guy ended up setting up the computers himself, mining \~2,000 BTC, and in 2013 when the price hit $1,000, sold half his stack to become a millionaire in college.

107,1acb8hq,Been buying bitcoin every month for 76 months now,"Started in October 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --> buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended.

But what caught my attention more than anything was all the people whining and complaining how they 'wished' they had bought in when BTC was in the low 40s and how they had missed that glorious opportunity. 

Well fellas... its time to put up or STFU cause that time is today. But judging by things around here I am guessing the modus operandi is going to be more and more whining, this time about how they 'wished' they had sold. And then a couple of weeks or months from now when the market recovers (as it always does) we'll have the same people whining about how they missed that golden opportunity of buying low yet again.. no wonder we have that prophetic joke about buying high and selling low.

129,s4vtk9,Ripple is funding propaganda against Bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy FUD,"Ripple labs has been funding ""research"" along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining. 

In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. 

[Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)

Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? 

[Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)

[Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. ](https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254)

Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!

Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. 

[Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as ""speaking fee"" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. 

Research with ""financial support"" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. 

Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)

As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. 

The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. 

[https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)

The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.


Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say ""reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it""

Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.

Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720

And if you open up the first page of it, says

> **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple‚Äôs University Blockchain Research Initiative.**

i.e this whole ""paper"" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen: 

https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/

Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.

Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created ""Tin"" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc. 

Lol at the shills shouting ""REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token"". They really did you good with this one small trick. 
Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment. 

The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.",3880,2651,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s4vtk9/ripple_is_funding_propaganda_against_bitcoin_by/,1642284900.0

And clueless media reporters are taking this to the next level by parroting and amplifying these distorted narratives.

[FBI can empty anybody's wallet. ](https://preview.redd.it/d0eup9f8f1471.jpg?width=1204&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e03f7dcdcf2a0252d84ce4217308a5de524b181b)

What rubbish, if FBI can empty anyone's wallet they can get BTC from the top addresses and all become billionaires themselves. This is some of the weakest FUD but people still seem to be falling for this.


Edit: Lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed ""quantum computers"" that can crack/hack bitcoin private keys. While quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future, they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address. 

As per u/BreakingBaIIs : 

> I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.

> If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.

The complexity of cracking a single BTC private key is large and currently not in existence. 

Moreover, if such a powerful computer existed, it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto. The entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption. Nothing would be safe. In fact, someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into Federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there, or hack into Bank of England and shut everything down. In other words, cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats, because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over. 

If they had quantum computers, they wont be asking Apple to de-encrypt devices seized from criminals. 

If they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any BTC address, they wont bother recovering measly 60 BTC from the 80 BTC ransom, when they can just send BTC to zero by hacking and moving Satoshi coins, thus destroying BTC's narrative completely. 

Tl:dr - Its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists. While it is true that research and development on quantum computers is an ongoing topic, there is no evidence to suggest that such a quantum computing system exists today that can derive BTC private keys from just the addresses.",6881,983,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nv38cv/media_says_it_doesnt_matter_where_the_bitcoin/,1623156401.0
145,tdthqw,Been buying bitcoin every month for almost 4.5 years,"Started in October 2017. Thought I was late, everybody does. Decided to buy as much bitcoin as possible. Basically this means buying from every paycheck as much as possible. It's the FIRE type of investing but replace S&P500 with bitcoin. It's been going pretty well, a couple of crashes here and there. If you manage to keep your emotions at bay, there's no better way of accumulating capital (and freedom in your life). I started to document my journey in this blog. Hopefully it gives you motivation to do something similar!

147,mflmpo,You guys asked for it so here it is: I built a bot that buys Bitcoin when Elon Musk Tweets about it and open sourced it,"In my last post, you guys were interested in my bot project that buys Bitcoin when Elon tweets about it so here it is!

The bot was initially designed to buy Bitcoin when Elon Musk tweets about, regardless of the sentiment of the tweet. I have shared it with some smaller communities, and there was some great feedback on it regarding the main concern - what if Elon tweets: ""Bitcoin is too high imo"" and the bot buys at the wrong time.

So I found an API that would help me analyse the tweet sentiment, and integrated this into the code. The bot will now only buy Bitcoin when Elon Tweets, if the sentiment of his tweet is positive.

I have tested the functionality and the bot is quite stable, but I haven't tested how profitable (if at all) it would actually be, so if you're interested in testing it, please share the results with us! :)

The bot was built mostly for fun, and I wouldn't encourage you to trade with it on a live account! But if you want to have some fun with it and try it out on a demo account, here you go:

Because that's the trick.  The trick to a 401K is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells, then everyone else who didn't sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash.    That's why they charge penalities.    

It's like investing in safemoon and they charge you penalities for selling In order to keep the current value more stable so the entirety of holders don't start panic selling it into oblivion.

Also you can panic sell a 401K too.  It happened to many people after the housing market crash of 2008.    My mom panic sold her 401k because it went from $50K to $9K ...I didn't know much about investing back then, but I will never forget what she said.  *I was afraid I would lose it all, it kept going down* 

What she said sounds much like what people say about Bitcoin today. 

Nowadays my mom is retired, and sometimes she brings that up...*I should've just kept it in...it went back up*

Unfortunately this is how the most powerful people work.  They shake out weak hands so they can buy up super low.   Otherwise there would be no big guy buying your shit back.  

Rich are buying your shit cheap for a reason...not just because they are just speculating. 


So yeah, you can get serious FUD with 401K and it's not just coming from my mom. Many honest hard working people don't understand the game whales play...they get shilled into things and are convinced it's safe because their employer offers it.    All a 401K is, is investments into stocks and bonds that are stable but not always safe. 

So if you can continually dump every paycheck into something that penalizes you for withdrawing early and hold that shit for 30 years , then you can buy Bitcoin  once and hold it for 3 years without any penality for withdrawing some too early unless tax on capital gains. But that's normal. 

So stick to your original plan, and hold.",6809,902,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nns2bs/if_you_can_hold_a_401k_plan_for_3040_years_you/,1622308958.0

He was relieved after finding the computer last month and had a professional data recovery company working on it for the last four weeks trying to recover his lost wallet, this cost alone was $400k.

Unfortunately it turns out the wallet was actually filled with bitcoin cash a hard fork of bitcoin worth a fraction of the price of actual bitcoin.

7,500 x $124 + $930k

so he is now about 1.6 million in debt to cover the cost of the loan he took out using the believed bitcoin as collateral.

Been quoted,  ""Bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people,"" and ""this is like better gold than gold.""  He also conceived of the Bitcoin Foundation but sadly he stopped contributing in 2016 and criticize bitcoin developers for not increasing network capacity and later got involved in bitcoin cash instead.

&#x200B;

You say to the cashier you want to pay in cryptocurrency and their system shows them a selection:

&#x200B;

[The amount is shown in Bolivares \(Bs.\) so 725 Bs.  so 30 USD \(exchange rate is 1 USD 24.2 Bs.\)](https://preview.redd.it/mrh1wr9h9poa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bd605c13966f94dee1cd3b37aff10619b5ea96a)

They say they will add more crypto and BTC LN.

After selecting bitcoin and and continue (Continuar) it shows the amount in bitcoin

&#x200B;

[So that is, 0.00124813 BTC, yesterday it was very volatile so even when BTC was around 27,200 USD using that rate I paid around 34 USD. Not much sense there, 4 USD more I suspect it s a fixed fee, wouldn't make sense be 10&#37;. After I took the picture he went again there and final price was 0.00124863 BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/74ejomjz9poa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a26782597706df63ea58256b28fbcb9287ec0a1)

After that it shows a QR code, you scan it and have to wait for at least one confirmation after you get one confirmation (mine took several minutes) the cashier press payment received and I suppose it checks one blockchain explorer for one confirmation or pending transaction that matches the amount. If it matches it says payment received and receipt is printed.

I noticed each time you press continuar a new QR code gets generated, so new or different address.

I used Trust Wallet and the fee was 1.36 USD.

Receipt is shown in Bolivares, but that is common here even if you pay with USD, Euros or any currency the invoice will be printed in Bolivares.

Experience was good overall, but in this case I paid a little more, something to improve.

You have to remember that here the economy is destroyed:

&#x200B;

* Monthly inflation can be over 10% easily. Being it under 10% is a success.
* Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. (less than 5 USD, this purchase was 5x monthly minimum wage), average monthly wage is 120 USD.
* Since 2007 14 zeroes were removed from the currency, so this 725 Bs would have been 72,500,000,000,000,000

The OP follows and RTs stuff like this

https://nitter.net/Quinnvestments/status/1446262224520105987?s=20


This quinn investment guy is a known fraudster who cooks up conspiracy theories, just have a look at his profile lol. 


Bullshit that has already been denied, like Tether holding Evergrande.. 
Infact this nonsense claims 78% of Tether reserves are Evergrande, which is total lies.

And that OP RT's nonsense like this, wishing for crypto to burn, but you all are assuming he is posting his ""unbiased opinion"" on bitcoin law. Lol


Edit:

Some comments are pointing out that I havent deboonked what that OP has said. I did actualyl debunk him last month, but then realised he isnt having honest debates but is just putting out propaganda. Given that he isnt acting in good faith, and is a buttcoiner, kinda pointless for me to debunk moreover, he is clearly lying that he wants to see crypto succeed, and instead has a very biased agenda. He is not debating in good faith. If you check his profile, he had posted that BTC would be a failure even before the roll out. Literally, before the plan was implemented and went live, he claimed it would be a failure. Anyone really expect this guy to be unbaised at this point? 

Coming to the protests, yes there are protests, but the protests are to do with politics rather than bitcoin. You will find one or two guys carrying an anti-bitcoin banner in the entire protest. Most of the protests are purely due to political reasons, that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. All those pictures he has posted as proof are all from protests shared on twitter, they have nothing to do with bitcoin except that fact that Bitcoin is implemented by the president, against whom all the protests are targeted. 

That guy claims Bitcoin rollout is ""not going well"". 

Stats from Google app store and IOS app store prove him wrong. 

The Chivo wallet is still #2 on ios app store, ahead of most viral apps like FB/ Whatsapp/Twitter/TikTok etc

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/apple/store-rank/sv/all/


And on Android play store, the wallet is the #1 app too..

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/store-rank/sv/all

The Chivo app is pretty much TOP on both app stores. Quite some failure huh! Definitely not doing well...

Just because there have been some issues during rollout doesnt mean its a failure or its not going well. Many mass implementation programs have problems initially, infact even the US covid stimmy checks took a while to arrive and there was implementation delays. Later, [WaPo reported that over 1 M checks went out to dead people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/06/25/irs-stimulus-checks-dead-people-gao/). Was that a failure too? 

Now lets look at some real stories that are success:

Over 3 million  users have downloaded the wallet. 

[More users in El Salvador are now using Chivo / have a bitcoin wallet than they have traditional bank accounts.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2021/10/07/in-el-salvador-more-people-have-bitcoin-wallets-than-traditional-bank-accounts/?sh=7ac1bb5020b5) - This alone is a massive win, in a country where huge amounts of people are unbanked, they have now instantly been given access to the world's most open and fair financial network. 

 Already, Brazil is considering following El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as well.


A country implementing BTC is not a race to the finish, it is a long term program. OP knows that too, but since he is a biased propagandist, he wants to put out hit pieces on a monthly basis 

That guy is just grinding his grudge against the president who he clearly hates, and using this sub as an outlet to air his political hit posts.",4208,892,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q3yh1b/top_el_salvador_post_is_by_a_butt_coiner_who/,1633702034.0

206,s97zb8,Bitcoin was supposed to be the solution to BIG MONEY. Now it instantly dips everytime when the stock market dips.,"To be honest, this makes me sad.

As far as I remember, Bitcoin was thought to be the solution of the fact that institutions, wall street and big money control the financial world and the pennies of the simple people from the normal population. And it was more or less like this, in the first several years after the inception of Bitcoin. We saw so much price discovery, Bitcoin being volatile, because mere mortals like us were buying, hodling, selling, wondering how much the *real* price of this asset is. It was literally supply and demand, controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us.

What do we see nowadays? We go to bed, we wake up and we see that Bitcoin is at -10% for no reason. Literally for no reason. Neither me or you have sold. We were just sleeping. What happens? Bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks. If the stock market is supposed to move down, bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond. We are not in control anymore. It doesn't matter if we buy or sell.

During the last few years, we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered. Now I realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been - big money controls the pennies, or in this case the satoshis, of us - the simple people.

It makes me sad, but in the end, this is an open and free market. Everybody has the right to buy, sell or hold as much as he or she wants. In this case, it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto, which gives us the spot on the sidelines - sit and observe how the price fluctuates, without being able to react on our own.

EDIT: I agree with a lot of you guys and girls. The same way sometimes we go to bed, wake up and see that Bitcoin is +15%. In those green days, nobody complains about it. What concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is. I am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about. However, it's a fact and I feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss it's impact.

EDIT 2: wow, thanks for the amazing discussion! I appreciate that so many people participate in it and share their view on the topic.",3060,1245,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s97zb8/bitcoin_was_supposed_to_be_the_solution_to_big/,1642761686.0

He just got permission to go public with his work.","He's been talking about it for months on twitter spaces. Look up @ JasonPLowery on twitter to find his account. When looking up his background information, everything looks legit. This is probably what Biden's advisor meant when he said that his administration was mining Bitcoin, because from what I've heard this kid say in those twitter spaces, the stuff he's trying to do for them would involve mining and much more. His plan is to make Bitcoin the GPS and Atomic Clock of digital information, a solid accurate ledger to store important information away from things like internet rot or wiki edits.

For those who don't know, our current internet is rotting away. When you search on google, it claims to have billions of results for any subject, but when you search through those subject's results and actually dig through the pages, you only get on average around 350 to 470 links.

The other billions? They've been lost to internet rot, the result of links being lost or destroyed from things like servers going offline, losing the data of billions of results per search, the loss of things you used to be able to find online but can no longer locate.

This apparently is a problem for the government as a lot of those lost links were links used in actual court cases, leading to digital evidence being lost that in some cases have been used to set legal precedents. There's a lot more to what he's doing for the military via the usage of Bitcoin's immutable ledger, but this is what I can remember off the top of my head.

Hopefully he can set up an AMA with the mods one day. I bet this community would be very interested in hearing what he has to say in regards of what he's doing with using Bitcoin's immutable blockchain on the most powerful computer network on earth for the Space Force and the Defense Department's needs.

>Somewhere in America, a lump of coal is burned every time a book is ordered on-line.

>The current fuel-economy rating: about 1 pound of coal to create,  package, store and move 2 megabytes of data. The digital age, it turns  out, is very energy-intensive. The Internet may someday save us bricks,  mortar and catalog paper, but it is burning up an awful lot of fossil  fuel in the process.

Media tried to gaslight and brainwash tech companies with the burning fossil fuel narrative. 

Some 20 years onwards, this entire article reads like a joke. 

>Getting the bits from dot-com to desktop requires still more  electricity. Cisco's 7500 series router, for example, keeps the Web hot  by routing an impressive 400 million bits per second, but to do that it  needs 1.5 kilowatts of power. The wireless Web draws even more power,  because its signals are broadcast in all directions, rather than being  tunneled down a wire or fiber  
>  
>Just fabricating all these digital boxes requires a tremendous amount of  electricity. The billion-dollar fabrication plants are packed with  furnaces, pumps, dryers and ion beams, all electrically driven. It takes  9 kilowatt-hours to etch circuits onto a square inch of silicon, and  about as much power to manufacture an entire PC (1,000 kilowatt-hours)as  it takes to run it for a year. And there are at least 300 of these factories in the U.S. Collectively,  fabs and their suppliers currently consume nearly 1% of the nation's  electric output.  
>  
>The global implications are enormous. Intel projects a billion people  on-line worldwide. That's $1 trillion in computer sales -- and another  $1 trillion investment in a hard-power backbone to supply electricity.  One billion PCs on the Web represent an electric demand equal to the  total capacity of the U.S. today.

Does this resemble the current attacks against cryptocurrencies? 

The exact same arguments are now used against bitcoin, trying to fool people into believing that bitcoin is the worst thing in the world. 

Thousands of people believe what these articles at face value despite not having any understanding of the intricacies of bitcoin mining


Edit: Lmao @ the dumpster fire the comment section is, everyone shilling their premined scamcoins like Nano. Its hilarious seeing Nano paid shills/bag holders trying to compare Nano's recurring spam outage (that costs a trivial $ amount to attack) to BTC 2018, during which you could still send transactions without any problem whatsoever. **Considering the aggressive nature of the shilling in comments, I am forced to update the thread with what Nano actually is...**

Nano is a scam that was premined at the press of a button, distributed among themselves by Colin using funny faucets where the insiders themselves claimed most of the tokens, then abruptly the faucet was closed, the team now having control of most of the coins decided to pump it to yahoo land on a fraudulent exchange and ride into the sunset while also cashing out slowly for years. No wonder Nano price has never even recovered past its early 2018 ATH, after 4 years its still down a huge % from ATH. (thats what happened when you have an endless premine ready to dump on you). Nano peddlers are pushing this as a competitor to BTC lmao. A stablecoin like DAI or USDC on any ETH L2 solution renders Nano as useless. Which is why almost no one talks about Nano except their own bagholders who try to push it aggressively.

I‚Äôm not going to argue against that. I actually do see a much higher ceiling for Bitcoin and see the store of value argument. In the 2010s I remember it being used for forms of payment and now in the 2020s as the price rose public sentiment changed as well. Now I hear it solely being mentioned as a store of value most likely due to it‚Äôs rising transaction fees with it‚Äôs growing demand. It seems we‚Äôve reached the point in it‚Äôs tech over time where we realized it‚Äôs usage has far outgrown the tech. Satoshi probably never envisioned adoption reaching this point.
