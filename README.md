# **Project 1: Financial Sentiment Analysis with Reddit data & Data Processing**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on acquiring, cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing financial text data for sentiment analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset is collected from **Reddit cryptocurrency discussions** using the **Reddit API**. The final deliverable includes processed datasets, code for data pipeline, exploratory insights, and feature engineering for further predictive modeling.

## **ðŸ”¹ Data Acquisition**
### **âœ… Source: Reddit API**
- Data is fetched from the **r/cryptocurrency** subreddit.
- **`praw`** library is used to extract posts mentioning Bitcoin.
- Extracted features:
  - **Title**: The title of the Reddit post
  - **Content**: The full post content
  - **Upvotes**: Number of upvotes on the post
  - **Comments**: Number of comments on the post
  - **Timestamp**: UNIX timestamp of post creation
  - **URL**: Link to the original post

### **ðŸ“œ How to Fetch Data**
Ensure you have **Reddit API credentials** set up before running the script.
```bash
pip install praw
python data_fetching.ipynb
```

## **ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
### **âœ… Cleaning Steps**
- **Standardizing column names** (lowercase, removing spaces)
- **Removing special characters & URLs** from text
- **Handling missing values** (filling NaN in `content` with "No content")
- **Dropping duplicates** based on **URL & Title**
- **Converting timestamps** to datetime format

### **ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Visualizing upvotes & comments distribution**
- **Checking correlation between engagement & sentiment**
- **Time-series analysis of Bitcoin-related discussions**

## **ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering**
### **âœ… Added Features**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `title_len` | Number of words in the post title |
| `content_len` | Number of words in the post content |
| `is_working_hours` | Whether the post was made during business hours (9AM - 5PM) |
| `engagement_score` | Weighted score of upvotes & comments |
| `upvote_to_comment_ratio` | Ratio of upvotes to comments |
| `has_bitcoin` | Whether "Bitcoin" appears in the title |

### **âœ… Sentiment Analysis**
- **VADER Sentiment Analyzer** applied to **title & content**
- **Labels**: Positive, Neutral, Negative

```bash
pip install vaderSentiment
python sentiment_analysis.py
```
