44.0,1h2vzcp,i hope people can see whats happening with us based cryptos and bitcoin,"crypto investor since 2017 made good money enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things i want with my life doesnt mean i know anything

it is my belief that at some point just like every other market there will be a bustselection period where 99 of projects become worthless of the remaining survivors maybe 56 take up 8085 of the market share 56 take up 510 and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 510

example theres verizon att t mobile at the top then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about there are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries tons of tv companies 56 that people know dozens that we dont 100s of other ones and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place

this is what will happen imo because it always does since forever

and while i dont really care if youre a fan of the us or not the us is the strongest economy in the world and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the us and global narrative im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world but i think its ignorant to outright say it wont matter

with the us and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future

i believe this is also why we have the dinous coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators meeting with senators getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us founders have all recently met are all iso 20022 compliant and are all going nuts i think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and i just want people to be aware of it these projects xlm xrp ada hbar algo are outperforming a lot of other coins and i believe this is why despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened

i am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if i had just kept my money where i had it 7 years ago in these dino coins in xrp and ada anyways id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects look at the narrative research it and make an educated guess do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out because it will at some point in the not so distant future",-0.7121998360609411,-0.2513613519688277,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h2vzcp/i_hope_people_can_see_whats_happening_with_us/,2024-11-29 21:11:55,2024-11-29,4.0,21.0,0.0,116.0,0.0,13.0,515.0,-0.573948290833307,-0.9513265684772475,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24878281526600066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18351196482254106,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07213301437861681,0.0,0.0,0.5554252286932363,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741242764853612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25781387949412155,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2941165492729349,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16527393895285297,0.0,0.0,0.2741242764853612,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3151187667353033,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14705827463646745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2741242764853612,0.0,0.2531477179164228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

48.0,1greczo,ethereum just hit a brand new 35 year low against bitcoin,"eth just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against btc after touching 03462 beating its last 3 and a half year low of 03465 set just 8 days ago on nov 06th 2024 03462 means 1 eth is worth 346 of 1 btc 

in fact this means eth has wiped all out gains against btc since april 2021 when eth was 2k and btc was around 60k since then eth has completed the merge moving it from pow to pos and protodanksharding which dropped the gas cost on l2s still in comparing its value against btc eth has officially lost all of its bear market gains



what you might not know is eth is not alone lots of alts continue to be down against btc

chainlink to btc is also sitting at a 5 and a half year low



perhaps one of the worst performing alts and sub darling dot continues to hover near an atl against btc



this list is not comprehensive but many alts are barely above recent bear market lows

just for fun ill also include the moon to btc chart which isnt great but is somehow better looking than a lot of the alts",-0.7029626221785062,-0.301908010202574,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1greczo/ethereum_just_hit_a_brand_new_35_year_low_against/,2024-11-14 20:27:07,2024-11-14,3.0,20.0,0.0,106.0,0.0,11.0,202.0,-0.5826462385857265,-1.0069770638429665,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17609331610856976,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3590031480733039,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5878894486807803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6179919347226717,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3355292065422648,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

not all of those who were early knew what the future would bring and there has always been a huge amount of uncertainty around i wouldnt even dare to amount the people who have lost their keys during this time it seems that even when you are uncertain of things you should never burn all of the bridges

but in the end the answer was obvious the worlds most popular digital currency really is nothing more than an abstraction so were destroying the private key used by our bitcon wallet that leaves our growing pile of bitcoin lucre locked away in a digital vault for all eternity  or at least until someone cracks the sha256 encryption that secures it

bitcoin spiked and then dumped normal sell the news market volatility right



nope apparently the etf was never approved a follow up tweet by gary gensler said the sec twitter account was compromised and that it was an unauthorized tweet



the sec announcement post is now deleted



with that lets acknowledge this sec tweet from oct 2023



i have a feeling if this wasnt an intern screwup  whoever made that fake announcement likely made huge money on volatility

72.0,n57xbt,bitcoin energy usage is a problem and the crypto space would only benefit if everyone admitted that,"lets be real a lot of people here think bitcoins energy consumption is not a problem or its just green people envious that they didnt make money

the top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520 more energy than bitcoin even though the top comments are saying its a bad argument there still a lot of people who think the article is right if you go on twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they dont get it how bitcoin is more efficient banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what 200 million bitcoin transactions you dont have to be a genius at math to see that theres no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions 

im not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless those people work on different areas that you like it or not are features bitcoin doesnt have banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from a to b you cant say the same about bitcoin transactions  big energy output  

but defi is the future we dont need banks you may be right but if you look at sites like nexocelsius they are still companies with employees they are competing with banks providing lendings customer supoort cards and insurance not bitcoin and they are doing fine

the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins arent using pow or will move to something else in the near future hmmm so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoins energy waste sorry but this is just delusional 

crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms and with more adoption it also comes spotlight if you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure pow and bitcoin is still using pow and consuming 10x energy from what it does now you should think thats theres the possibility governments could act against mining this year you saw hash rate drop with governmentinstituted blackouts in china it wouldnt take much for countries to criminalize pow mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting im the king 

tldr bitcoins pow is a cow infinitely farting there shouldnt be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes",1.2112575130002188,2.27050705612565,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n57xbt/bitcoin_energy_usage_is_a_problem_and_the_crypto/,2021-05-05 05:06:58,2021-05-05,2.0,5.0,0.0,36.0,0.0,17.0,447.0,1.5290323759378481,0.37035771279916274,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.106119852770735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21634757104739047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.434968914227227,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4862917824689006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4032831306455739,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.463592952815224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37242306849305795,0.0,0.0,0.0

79.0,lra6ps,im honestly not buying this billionaire  bitcoin relationship anymore,"i praised btc in the past so many times because it introduced me to concepts i never thought about but this recent news of billionaires joining the party got me thinking since when are the people teaming up with those that are the root cause of their problems

now i know that some names like elon musk can be pardoned for one reason or another but seeing michael saylor and mark cuban talk bitcoin with the very embodiment of centralization  cz binance i dont like where this is going

not to mention that we all expected btc to become peertopeer cash not a store of value for edgy hedge funds it feels like we are going in the opposite direction when compared to the defi space and communitydriven projects


as far as i am concerned the king is dead the billionaire friends  co are holding him hostage while telling us that everything is completely fine this is not what i came here for and what i stand for i still believe decentralization will prevail even if the likes of binance keep faking transactions on their chains and claiming that the users have abandoned eth

88.0,qqtjjn,ethereum classic and bitcoin cash are pumpingwhich means the latest batch of noob retail investors have finally arrived,"i think many of you would consider ethereum classic a terrible investment considering 1 it was the result of a hack and 2 the hacker still has their bags of etc available which they periodically dump on unsuspecting investors bitcoin cash doesnt have such a problematic origin but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to btc and other good projects

so when i open the charts and see that specifically bch and etc have been pumping hard for the last couple of days my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on cheaper projects with the name bitcoin and ethereum in it i should know i did this exact thing myself earlier this year

heres hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too

x200b



this got me to thinking about the first time i heard of bitcoin i was a freshman in college and a computer science major it was fall of 2010 i was in the lab when a sophomore csci major asked me if i wanted to help him set up the 35 computers in the lab for mining bitcoin  his plan was to mine every night after classes ended until 8am when classes began again and 24 hours over the weekend

me thinking it was a waste of time with bitcoin being like 06 said no the guy ended up setting up the computers himself mining 2000 btc and in 2013 when the price hit 1000 sold half his stack to become a millionaire in college 

where were you the first time you heard of bitcoin and what was the price per coin",0.10182963732862435,0.14071678081725852,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xx6bv7/the_first_website_to_buy_bitcoin_went_online_13/,2022-10-06 14:14:49,2022-10-06,3.0,14.0,0.0,191.0,1.0,20.0,182.0,0.1134957803752146,0.08926811548758774,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.649281947655645,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.19748117088317557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6307504947838786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3762817467337402,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

double standard cause the us have done far worse than this in literally every war they financed andor were directly involved with yet if anyone mentions this theyre accused of being putin apologists

i cant fathom how cruel some people can get and calling for the hunger of a whole nation because of the actions of their fucked up dictator  do you americans think that you your families and tour children deserve to suffer and famined because of your governments actions in the middle east latin america and around the world  do you 

fuck every single government power to the people

you dont understand the basics of decentralisation its not hooray decentralisation unless some with a different belief system is using it god i hate this sub lately

edit  i mentioned the us doing far worse to point out that the american people dont deserve living in a famine for their governments actions same like the russian people or any other nations people for that matter not because im prodictatorship like people are accusing me of but i think i wont defend myself anymore cause some people are so agenda oriented and so blind to the truth even if you hit them in the face with it and will always see anyone who speaks out against the state media points as puting apologist or prodictator or whatever new trendy name is used for public shaming anyone who thinks outside the flock",0.0598772909458997,1.639356891152926,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tniwhf/everyone_was_for_decentralisation_until_russia/,2022-03-25 10:26:59,2022-03-25,4.0,10.0,0.0,109.0,1.0,39.0,331.0,0.5337211710080075,0.022686318453789725,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1179939615161688,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5154659340870449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27655760310255906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4984119168379348,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4299262938756127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45895220992601654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

but what caught my attention more than anything was all the people whining and complaining how they wished they had bought in when btc was in the low 40s and how they had missed that glorious opportunity 

well fellas its time to put up or stfu cause that time is today but judging by things around here i am guessing the modus operandi is going to be more and more whining this time about how they wished they had sold and then a couple of weeks or months from now when the market recovers as it always does well have the same people whining about how they missed that golden opportunity of buying low yet again no wonder we have that prophetic joke about buying high and selling low

129.0,s4vtk9,ripple is funding propaganda against bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy fud,"ripple labs has been funding research along with government entities to spread propaganda against bitcoin and mining 

in 2021 they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in new york has increased by 6 per month because of mining 

claim mining drives up household electricity bills

surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices but mining 

since june 2020 natural gas prices have gone up by 35037 in the usa henry hub natural gas futures rolling contracts

not just in usa in uk natural gas is at decadal highs 

surely electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs but is due to bitcoin mining

crude oil wti futures are currently at 84 for comparison it was around 56 in nov 2019 pre pandemic the last time wti was above 80 was all the way back in 2014 increasing crude oil natural gas prices along with inflation that is at multidecade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity but its bitcoin mining that is responsible 

thats according to this study funded by ripple in collusion with the department of treasury  the same department of treasury headed by another well known bitcoin hater janet yellen who earned 7m as speaking fee from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity 

research with financial support is nothing but propaganda especially when its funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders 

ripple has also cozied up with the likes of wef the very organisations bitcoin was created as a fuck you to 

as its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up as usual they will fail 

the narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in ny is rubbish as the largest btc mining companies in new york produce their own energy infact the last one to start mining in ny is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years before they started mining bitcoin last year 



the other large mining company greenidge generation also produces its own energy


edit buttcoin losers in comments say reee bitcoin move to pos or govt will ban it

yeah not too bright the whole point of bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button

another one who is literally a war monger calling for ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global ewaste lmao bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


edit ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything well here is the paper 

and if you open up the first page of it says

 benetton and compiani acknowledge financial support from ripples university blockchain research initiative

ie this whole paper is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

the other writer of this paper is adiar morse who conveniently works for the dept of treasury under yellen 



seems like natural career progression  collect funds from ripple to publish propaganda against bitcoin and get hired by yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now nothing to see here

final edit jjust look at the number of freshly created tin accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for xrp didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders it must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 13rd of their 2017 ath while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of  and made new highs this cycle thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb garlinghouse etc 

lol at the shills shouting reee ripple is a company xrp is decentralised token they really did you good with this one small trick 
thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50 on your shitcoin investment 

the d in xrp stands for decentralised it was always a premined scam token and will always be one thousands of tin bagholders wont change this",-0.19106701952691196,2.607940152983362,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s4vtk9/ripple_is_funding_propaganda_against_bitcoin_by/,2022-01-15 22:15:00,2022-01-15,5.0,22.0,1.0,172.0,0.0,16.0,752.0,0.6486351322261702,-0.052957369420033464,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45645991504256134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13883373595910903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5864400819500345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5276044228761956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2830416813626715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26453459050619327,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

144.0,nv38cv,media says it doesnt matter where the bitcoin wallet isthe fbi still can get access these are dishonest lies stop lying and fooling people fbi  media,"according to media reporters fbi claims that it can get access to bitcoin stored anywhere that is just impossible unless somehow they have developed ways to crack sha256 and brute force wallet private keys in which case btc is the least of everyones worries and statenuclear secrets could be under risk 

while bitcoin isnt stored on a server the private keys to unlock the bitcoin may have been in any event an fbi official just told reporters that it doesnt matter where the bitcoin wallet isthe fbi still can get access they wont say how

and clueless media reporters are taking this to the next level by parroting and amplifying these distorted narratives

fbi can empty anybodys wallet 

what rubbish if fbi can empty anyones wallet they can get btc from the top addresses and all become billionaires themselves this is some of the weakest fud but people still seem to be falling for this


edit lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed quantum computers that can crackhack bitcoin private keys while quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address 

as per ubreakingbaiis  

 i did a backofenvelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force

 if the fbi found a way to efficiently crack a private key that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced that pnp in the affirmative what they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the internets security protocols which they could do they would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years plus many new ones we never thought about in a matter of days or hours they would be able to efficiently create superhuman ai using modest computational resources

the complexity of cracking a single btc private key is large and currently not in existence 

moreover if such a powerful computer existed it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto the entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption nothing would be safe in fact someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there or hack into bank of england and shut everything down in other words cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over 

if they had quantum computers they wont be asking apple to deencrypt devices seized from criminals 

if they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any btc address they wont bother recovering measly 60 btc from the 80 btc ransom when they can just send btc to zero by hacking and moving satoshi coins thus destroying btcs narrative completely 

tldr  its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists while it is true that research and development on quantum computers is an ongoing topic there is no evidence to suggest that such a quantum computing system exists today that can derive btc private keys from just the addresses",0.38645129008114615,0.3292421547701502,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nv38cv/media_says_it_doesnt_matter_where_the_bitcoin/,2021-06-08 12:46:41,2021-06-08,1.0,12.0,0.0,148.0,1.0,26.0,558.0,0.36928854948784734,0.29073054047700625,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25544089092472644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384808286103455,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.060473037732820936,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26418123844208896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1566144864263505,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1417384258721395,0.7952971221351897,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22034135186069784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25544089092472644,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21613942793044721

147.0,mflmpo,you guys asked for it so here it is i built a bot that buys bitcoin when elon musk tweets about it and open sourced it,"in my last post you guys were interested in my bot project that buys bitcoin when elon tweets about it so here it is

the bot was initially designed to buy bitcoin when elon musk tweets about regardless of the sentiment of the tweet i have shared it with some smaller communities and there was some great feedback on it regarding the main concern  what if elon tweets bitcoin is too high imo and the bot buys at the wrong time

so i found an api that would help me analyse the tweet sentiment and integrated this into the code the bot will now only buy bitcoin when elon tweets if the sentiment of his tweet is positive

i have tested the functionality and the bot is quite stable but i havent tested how profitable if at all it would actually be so if youre interested in testing it please share the results with us 

the bot was built mostly for fun and i wouldnt encourage you to trade with it on a live account but if you want to have some fun with it and try it out on a demo account here you go

153.0,nns2bs,if you can hold a 401k plan for 3040 years you can hold bitcoin for 34 years,"you also only have to buy into btc once unlike a 401k where most people keep buying back in every pay check only to lose what you earned in interest by paying a penalty if you withdraw too early   because thats the trick  the trick to a 401k is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells then everyone else who didnt sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash    thats why they charge penalities    

its like investing in safemoon and they charge you penalities for selling in order to keep the current value more stable so the entirety of holders dont start panic selling it into oblivion

also you can panic sell a 401k too  it happened to many people after the housing market crash of 2008    my mom panic sold her 401k because it went from 50k to 9k i didnt know much about investing back then but i will never forget what she said  i was afraid i would lose it all it kept going down 

what she said sounds much like what people say about bitcoin today 

nowadays my mom is retired and sometimes she brings that upi shouldve just kept it init went back up

unfortunately this is how the most powerful people work  they shake out weak hands so they can buy up super low   otherwise there would be no big guy buying your shit back  

rich are buying your shit cheap for a reasonnot just because they are just speculating 


so yeah you can get serious fud with 401k and its not just coming from my mom many honest hard working people dont understand the game whales playthey get shilled into things and are convinced its safe because their employer offers it    all a 401k is is investments into stocks and bonds that are stable but not always safe 

so if you can continually dump every paycheck into something that penalizes you for withdrawing early and hold that shit for 30 years  then you can buy bitcoin  once and hold it for 3 years without any penality for withdrawing some too early unless tax on capital gains but thats normal 

so stick to your original plan and hold",0.372595469257494,0.218585957015192,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nns2bs/if_you_can_hold_a_401k_plan_for_3040_years_you/,2021-05-29 17:22:38,2021-05-29,5.0,17.0,1.0,120.0,1.0,17.0,370.0,0.32639261558480337,0.3057605145640529,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1919868077254337,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8999682812511065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3914053632761394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

158.0,11ji1zw,man who accidently threw away his computer filled with bitcoin has finally found it in the dump,"after years of looking for his lost computer that he believed was filled with 7500 bitcoins the man has found it

the entire thing cost him around 25 million after paying for excavators labor and city permits to dig up the landfill he was relieved after finding the computer last month and had a professional data recovery company working on it for the last four weeks trying to recover his lost wallet this cost alone was 400k

unfortunately it turns out the wallet was actually filled with bitcoin cash a hard fork of bitcoin worth a fraction of the price of actual bitcoin

7500 x 124  930k

so he is now about 16 million in debt to cover the cost of the loan he took out using the believed bitcoin as collateral

its the same situation as gold and gold mining  the marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold  gold mining is a waste but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange

i think the case will be the same for bitcoin  the utility of the exchanges made possible by bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used  therefore not having bitcoin would be the net waste",0.18169304902050842,0.5136691510284137,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mj8f09/anyone_else_find_it_a_bit_odd_being_told_how/,2021-04-03 13:23:06,2021-04-03,5.0,13.0,1.0,18.0,1.0,38.0,87.0,0.28128587962288,0.12003484968763678,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.28277074818025394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.959187522840857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

173.0,x607js,til there used to be a bitcoin faucet that literally gave away 5 bitcoins just to solve a captcha,"12 years ago in 2010 a fellow named gavin andresen created the first cryptocurrency faucet  he made this simple website giving away 5 bitcoin  not a typo five  just for solving a captcha  it has since been archived and what is crazy was that the snapshot on that day showed that there was still 750 bitcoin to give away  5 bitcoin is basically 100000 usd in todays price and at its all time high this would had equate to 325000 just for visiting a website more than likely you could had just visited once everyday or even more

x200b



from wikipedia source gavin andresen is a bitcoin pioneer and was one of the few developers that actually developed alongside with satoshi nakamoto who declared him as the lead developer for the client bitcoin software  been quoted  bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people and this is like better gold than gold  he also conceived of the bitcoin foundation but sadly he stopped contributing in 2016 and criticize bitcoin developers for not increasing network capacity and later got involved in bitcoin cash instead

174.0,ttzm52,quantum computer solves bitcoins algorithm for the first time in history btc drops 20 in minutes,"new research team has built a quantum machine with 13 million qubits that cracked bitcoin encryption

scientists from the university of sussex in the uk have built quantum systems with 13 million qubits which was sufficient enough to break the cryptographic algorithm sha256 that secures the bitcoin blockchain within the space of 24 hours

the ability to break the encryption protecting the bitcoin network allows researchers to catch transactions and reroute coins into their own wallet

179.0,11vnevt,i went to the supermarket here in venezuela and paid directly with bitcoin,"hi guys as you probably know im venezuelan living here

yesterday i had the chance of doing some purchases in a supermarket and paying directly in bitcoin

this was the purchase

the purchase i had purchased some things before like fruits and vegetables in farmers market and chickenmeat

x200b

you say to the cashier you want to pay in cryptocurrency and their system shows them a selection

x200b

the amount is shown in bolivares bs so 725 bs  so 30 usd exchange rate is 1 usd 242 bs

they say they will add more crypto and btc ln

after selecting bitcoin and and continue continuar it shows the amount in bitcoin

x200b

so that is 000124813 btc yesterday it was very volatile so even when btc was around 27200 usd using that rate i paid around 34 usd not much sense there 4 usd more i suspect it s a fixed fee wouldnt make sense be 1037 after i took the picture he went again there and final price was 000124863 btc

after that it shows a qr code you scan it and have to wait for at least one confirmation after you get one confirmation mine took several minutes the cashier press payment received and i suppose it checks one blockchain explorer for one confirmation or pending transaction that matches the amount if it matches it says payment received and receipt is printed

i noticed each time you press continuar a new qr code gets generated so new or different address

i used trust wallet and the fee was 136 usd

receipt is shown in bolivares but that is common here even if you pay with usd euros or any currency the invoice will be printed in bolivares

experience was good overall but in this case i paid a little more something to improve

you have to remember that here the economy is destroyed

x200b

 monthly inflation can be over 10 easily being it under 10 is a success
 monthly minimum wage is 130 bs less than 5 usd this purchase was 5x monthly minimum wage average monthly wage is 120 usd
 since 2007 14 zeroes were removed from the currency so this 725 bs would have been 72500000000000000

so you can see that jp morgan was speaking fullon against crypto while their actual actions are something else already in 2021 they launched their own bitcoin fund for private clients and just like other investment banks they were expanding crypto too

196.0,q3yh1b,top el salvador post is by a butt coiner who wants bitcoin to crash to 1k he is not offering any unbiased perspective nor does he want crypto to succeed,"the controversial top post about el salvadors op claims that he wants crypto to succeed 

but if you go into his profile linked in that post you can see that he is wishing for bitcoin to go to 1k lmao



this guy literally wants crypto to burn but yall are celebrating him because he is putting out unbiased perspectives lmao



nobody who wants crypto to succeed will wish for 1k btc and rt known fudsters its hilarious people even fall for this 


the op follows and rts stuff like this




this quinn investment guy is a known fraudster who cooks up conspiracy theories just have a look at his profile lol 


bullshit that has already been denied like tether holding evergrande 
infact this nonsense claims 78 of tether reserves are evergrande which is total lies

and that op rts nonsense like this wishing for crypto to burn but you all are assuming he is posting his unbiased opinion on bitcoin law lol


edit

some comments are pointing out that i havent deboonked what that op has said i did actualyl debunk him last month but then realised he isnt having honest debates but is just putting out propaganda given that he isnt acting in good faith and is a buttcoiner kinda pointless for me to debunk moreover he is clearly lying that he wants to see crypto succeed and instead has a very biased agenda he is not debating in good faith if you check his profile he had posted that btc would be a failure even before the roll out literally before the plan was implemented and went live he claimed it would be a failure anyone really expect this guy to be unbaised at this point 

coming to the protests yes there are protests but the protests are to do with politics rather than bitcoin you will find one or two guys carrying an antibitcoin banner in the entire protest most of the protests are purely due to political reasons that have nothing to do with bitcoin all those pictures he has posted as proof are all from protests shared on twitter they have nothing to do with bitcoin except that fact that bitcoin is implemented by the president against whom all the protests are targeted 

that guy claims bitcoin rollout is not going well 

stats from google app store and ios app store prove him wrong 

the chivo wallet is still 2 on ios app store ahead of most viral apps like fb whatsapptwittertiktok etc




and on android play store the wallet is the 1 app too



the chivo app is pretty much top on both app stores quite some failure huh definitely not doing well

just because there have been some issues during rollout doesnt mean its a failure or its not going well many mass implementation programs have problems initially infact even the us covid stimmy checks took a while to arrive and there was implementation delays later wapo reported that over 1 m checks went out to dead people was that a failure too 

now lets look at some real stories that are success

over 3 million  users have downloaded the wallet 

more users in el salvador are now using chivo  have a bitcoin wallet than they have traditional bank accounts  this alone is a massive win in a country where huge amounts of people are unbanked they have now instantly been given access to the worlds most open and fair financial network 

 already brazil is considering following el salvador adopting bitcoin as well


a country implementing btc is not a race to the finish it is a long term program op knows that too but since he is a biased propagandist he wants to put out hit pieces on a monthly basis 

that guy is just grinding his grudge against the president who he clearly hates and using this sub as an outlet to air his political hit posts",-0.12794605799694092,0.20492469803309843,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q3yh1b/top_el_salvador_post_is_by_a_butt_coiner_who/,2021-10-08 14:07:14,2021-10-08,4.0,14.0,0.0,212.0,1.0,30.0,656.0,-0.028084831187929114,-0.10618593693514473,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694932758632589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4675008243378489,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2594057306005118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38841293193840304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4414217219354396,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22563638371889755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21088282150887755,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3694932758632589,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

206.0,s97zb8,bitcoin was supposed to be the solution to big money now it instantly dips everytime when the stock market dips,"to be honest this makes me sad

as far as i remember bitcoin was thought to be the solution of the fact that institutions wall street and big money control the financial world and the pennies of the simple people from the normal population and it was more or less like this in the first several years after the inception of bitcoin we saw so much price discovery bitcoin being volatile because mere mortals like us were buying hodling selling wondering how much the real price of this asset is it was literally supply and demand controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us

what do we see nowadays we go to bed we wake up and we see that bitcoin is at 10 for no reason literally for no reason neither me or you have sold we were just sleeping what happens bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks if the stock market is supposed to move down bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond we are not in control anymore it doesnt matter if we buy or sell

during the last few years we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered now i realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been  big money controls the pennies or in this case the satoshis of us  the simple people

it makes me sad but in the end this is an open and free market everybody has the right to buy sell or hold as much as he or she wants in this case it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto which gives us the spot on the sidelines  sit and observe how the price fluctuates without being able to react on our own

edit i agree with a lot of you guys and girls the same way sometimes we go to bed wake up and see that bitcoin is 15 in those green days nobody complains about it what concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is i am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about however its a fact and i feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss its impact

edit 2 wow thanks for the amazing discussion i appreciate that so many people participate in it and share their view on the topic",-0.3488694233518395,0.6871671401010024,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s97zb8/bitcoin_was_supposed_to_be_the_solution_to_big/,2022-01-21 10:41:26,2022-01-21,4.0,10.0,0.0,70.0,1.0,20.0,435.0,-0.03805845431598692,-0.2067782231290697,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4074455083177672,0.0,0.36410716751637207,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11399802356512956,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4434095115557665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4434095115557665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49800936375057,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21721248278731722,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

i asked if anyone paid with crypto before and they said only one i am not a fan of paying for daily needs with crypto just yet and i thought el salvador accepting btc as a legal tender was too early but i really needed to try this so i paid for everyone with btc and it was nice

with the current inflation in iran which is insane and is estimated to be around 50 to 150 most people are converting their savings to us dollars and now crypto 1 usd equalls to 280000 iranian rials today i hope crypto saves most of us",-0.18683329649746266,0.27869549653640385,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pnbxlh/yesterday_i_payed_for_coffee_with_bitcoin_in_iran/,2021-09-13 09:19:03,2021-09-13,0.0,9.0,0.0,231.0,1.0,9.0,160.0,-0.047174658587302715,-0.14611242238948763,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15272493493144826,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4878000664216925,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6451171448947514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5679349071962576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

217.0,rbwopc,theres a guy who the space force and defense department are paying 250k a year to go to mit to study bitcoin for them to see how they could use its ledger in the same way they use gps to store and track accurate immutable information he just got permission to go public with his work,"hes been talking about it for months on twitter spaces look up  jasonplowery on twitter to find his account when looking up his background information everything looks legit this is probably what bidens advisor meant when he said that his administration was mining bitcoin because from what ive heard this kid say in those twitter spaces the stuff hes trying to do for them would involve mining and much more his plan is to make bitcoin the gps and atomic clock of digital information a solid accurate ledger to store important information away from things like internet rot or wiki edits

for those who dont know our current internet is rotting away when you search on google it claims to have billions of results for any subject but when you search through those subjects results and actually dig through the pages you only get on average around 350 to 470 links

the other billions theyve been lost to internet rot the result of links being lost or destroyed from things like servers going offline losing the data of billions of results per search the loss of things you used to be able to find online but can no longer locate

this apparently is a problem for the government as a lot of those lost links were links used in actual court cases leading to digital evidence being lost that in some cases have been used to set legal precedents theres a lot more to what hes doing for the military via the usage of bitcoins immutable ledger but this is what i can remember off the top of my head

hopefully he can set up an ama with the mods one day i bet this community would be very interested in hearing what he has to say in regards of what hes doing with using bitcoins immutable blockchain on the most powerful computer network on earth for the space force and the defense departments needs

230.0,ubf4xk,in 1999 media attacked the internet a lump of coal is burnt everytime a book is ordered online today the same attack has shifted towards bitcoin,"in the early days of the internet media hit pieces tried to blame the internet for energy consumption

somewhere in america a lump of coal is burned every time a book is ordered online



the current fueleconomy rating about 1 pound of coal to create  package store and move 2 megabytes of data the digital age it turns  out is very energyintensive the internet may someday save us bricks  mortar and catalog paper but it is burning up an awful lot of fossil  fuel in the process  
  
there are already over 17000 pure dotcom companies ebay etrade etc  
  
the larger ones each represent the electric load of a small village

media tried to gaslight and brainwash tech companies with the burning fossil fuel narrative 

some 20 years onwards this entire article reads like a joke 

getting the bits from dotcom to desktop requires still more  electricity ciscos 7500 series router for example keeps the web hot  by routing an impressive 400 million bits per second but to do that it  needs 15 kilowatts of power the wireless web draws even more power  because its signals are broadcast in all directions rather than being  tunneled down a wire or fiber  
  
just fabricating all these digital boxes requires a tremendous amount of  electricity the billiondollar fabrication plants are packed with  furnaces pumps dryers and ion beams all electrically driven it takes  9 kilowatthours to etch circuits onto a square inch of silicon and  about as much power to manufacture an entire pc 1000 kilowatthoursas  it takes to run it for a year and there are at least 300 of these factories in the us collectively  fabs and their suppliers currently consume nearly 1 of the nations  electric output  
  
the global implications are enormous intel projects a billion people  online worldwide thats 1 trillion in computer sales  and another  1 trillion investment in a hardpower backbone to supply electricity  one billion pcs on the web represent an electric demand equal to the  total capacity of the us today

does this resemble the current attacks against cryptocurrencies 

the exact same arguments are now used against bitcoin trying to fool people into believing that bitcoin is the worst thing in the world 

thousands of people believe what these articles at face value despite not having any understanding of the intricacies of bitcoin mining


edit lmao  the dumpster fire the comment section is everyone shilling their premined scamcoins like nano its hilarious seeing nano paid shillsbag holders trying to compare nanos recurring spam outage that costs a trivial  amount to attack to btc 2018 during which you could still send transactions without any problem whatsoever considering the aggressive nature of the shilling in comments i am forced to update the thread with what nano actually is

nano is a scam that was premined at the press of a button distributed among themselves by colin using funny faucets where the insiders themselves claimed most of the tokens then abruptly the faucet was closed the team now having control of most of the coins decided to pump it to yahoo land on a fraudulent exchange and ride into the sunset while also cashing out slowly for years no wonder nano price has never even recovered past its early 2018 ath after 4 years its still down a huge  from ath thats what happened when you have an endless premine ready to dump on you nano peddlers are pushing this as a competitor to btc lmao a stablecoin like dai or usdc on any eth l2 solution renders nano as useless which is why almost no one talks about nano except their own bagholders who try to push it aggressively 


fraudsters on this tread will try to push such scams to unsuspecting readers lol",-0.4198805050730569,0.26503423755431027,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ubf4xk/in_1999_media_attacked_the_internet_a_lump_of/,2022-04-25 07:07:38,2022-04-25,0.0,7.0,0.0,124.0,0.0,26.0,625.0,-0.21440608228484676,-0.331912364589287,1.0,0.0,0.4399989292812563,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.37230185237994856,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10416527971109808,0.0,0.0,0.267358041269669,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39585524300735014,0.0,0.4550542461307378,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4269574206251315,0.0,0.0,0.198477116696293,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
